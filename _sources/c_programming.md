### _What is the operator precedence in C?_
 
What will the value of Y be when you have Y = X & 0xE0 >> 2? Are you anticipating that the operation will involve bit masking followed by shifting, as in (P4->IN & 0xE0) >> 2? In C/C++, it's important to note that << and >> take precedence over & (bitwise AND). Therefore, X & 0xE0 >> 2 is equivalent to P4->IN & (0xE0 >> 2) or P4->IN & 0x03.

Remember the arithmetic order of operations; for instance, 2 + 2 x 2 equals 6, not 8. If you're uncertain about the precedence order, it's advisable to use parentheses. I may not recall the entire precedence order, but I follow best coding practices by using parentheses. Otherwise, you might spend hours or even days debugging your code. For further reference, you can check operator precedence on the table below. 

Here is a quiz:

One of these is correct.  One is incorrect. Or are they both the same?
```C
while( (SysTick->CTRL & 0x00010000) == 0 );
```
or
```C
while( SysTick->CTRL & 0x00010000 == 0 );   
``` 

You can find the precedence order in the textbook on page 111 or below:

**_Are there different versions of C?_**

Indeed, there exist various versions or dialects of the C programming language standard. These include C79, C89, C99, C11, and C17, among others. You can find more information about these versions on this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#History
 
The most recent standard is C17, but the most widely adopted versions are likely C89 (also known as ANSI C) and C79 (K&R C). CCS provides support for K&R, C89, C99, and C11. 

If you wish to switch between these dialects, you can do so by navigating to project properties, then CCS Build > Advanced Options > Language Options, and select your desired dialect, as illustrated in the image below:

![C Dialect](./figures/C_Dialect.png)

It's worth noting that the default dialect in CCS is C89, but ECE382 employs C11 to facilitate features like variable declaration within for-loops, as seen in the example: `(int i = 0; ... )`.


### _What is the switch statement, and how does it work?_

The switch statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of several constant integer values and branches accordingly.

```C
switch (expression) {
    case const-expr:  
        statements
        break;
    case const-expr:  
        statements
        break;
    default:
        statements
        break;
}
``` 

If you don't add `break`, the program will flow through the following case statements.  Here is an example

```C
int nwhite, nother, ndigit[10]; 

while ((ch == getchar()) != EOF) {
    switch (ch) {
        case '0':   case '1':  case '2' :  case '3': case '4' :       
        case '5':   case '6':  case '7' :  case '8': case '9' :   
        // if ch is between '0' and '9'
            ndigit[ch-'0']++;
            break;
        case ' ': 
        case '\n':
        case '\t':   
        // if ch is a space, \n, or \t
            nwhite++;
            break;
        default:
            nother++;
            break;
    }
}
```

### _What is the _static_ qualifier?_

The functions inside C files are by default *global* functions.  Although they are not declared in the associated .h files, the functions can be seen (and even called - I don't want to show you how because it is not good practice) by other files. So, you will have a compile error if you have two functions with the same name in two C files.  
 
Then, how can you make the function invisible to other files?  Use the *static* qualifier.  It makes your functions private in the C file they are defined. 
 
Variables declared outside functions are also global variables, and other files can see them.  They can also be static to make them private (again invisible by other files) - this is different from the static variables inside a function.

Ritche invented the C programming language.  This is the **best book** for C programming and the most popular one.
