## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Students should be able to develop a system to control the speed of the two motors.
- Students should be able to evaluate the performance of the control system.

## ðŸ“œ Synopsis

Armed with the previous labs, we now have the means to drive the robot and measure the speed of the robot, the distance traveled, the position of the robot from the line, and the distance to the walls.  In this lab, we will implement automatic controllers that cause the robot to perform the motions, such as following a line and driving between the walls. The control methods that we will use fall into the class called **proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control** systems.   

If the controller does **not** use a measure of the system output in computing the control action to take, the system is called **open-loop control**.  An example is the drive-in-maze exercise in Lab14.  If the system output is measured and fed back for use in the controller computation, the system is called a **closed-loop** or **feedback control** system. Shown in the figure below are open-loop control (top) and  closed-loop control (bottom).

Control systems are a rich and complex field within engineering spanning: electrical engineering, robotics engineering, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer engineering. This module provides a brief introduction.

## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Setup

- Go to ECE382 Teams > General > Files > Class Materials > SourceFiles.
- Download `Program17_1.c`, `Program17_2.c`, and `Program17_3.c` from the Teams folder into your `/workspace/Lab17_Control` folder using Windows File Explorer (not Code Composer Studio). **Caution**: It must be in the `Lab17_Control` folder not in the `inc` folder.
- Download `TimerA2.c` into your workspace/inc folder using Windows File Explorer (not Code Composer Studio). You need to overwrite the existing `TimerA2.c`. **Caution**: It must be in the `inc` folder not in the `Lab17_Control` folder.
- Right-click on your `Lab17_Control` project in CCS and select "Add Files...". Browse to your `inc` folder and select `TimerA2.c`. Click Open. Ensure "Link to file" is selected and create a link to the "PROJECT\_LOC". 

### Implement a proportional controller in `Program17_1`

- **This is part of Homework 17** 
- Read the entire code in `Program17_1.c`. 
- Complete the `Controller` function in `Program17_1.c`.
- Follow the instructions inside `Program17_1.c` to complete it.
- Do **not** implement a proportional-integral (PI) controller for this homework. 
- Copy and paste the code you wrote inside `Controller()` in Gradescope to submit your Homework 17.

### Implement a proportional-integral controller in `Program17_1`

- Complete the `Controller()` function in `Program17_1.c`
- Create a proportional-integral controller to drive both motors at the desired speed. 
- Experimentally determine the best $K_p$ and $K_i$ constants to create a stable system. 
- You can change $K_p$ and $K_i$ at line 80 inside `Program17_1`.  You can also change them on the fly using the bump switches for fine tuning.
- Record the $K_p$ and $K_i$ values and report them in the following section.
- Demo `Program17_1()` showing a proportional-integral controller that regulates the wheel speeds of 50 rpm and 100 rpm in the presence of external disturbance.  You should apply disturbance after the speed settles at the desired speed.

### Discuss the performance of your controller in `Program17_1()`


- Collect the data for the wheel speed of 100 rpm via the USB/UART port and discuss the performance of your controller in `Program17_1()`. 
- You may need to change the Serial Terminal buffer size.  The default is 1000 lines.  If you need more than 1000 lines, you need to change it. The instruction is [here](FAQ:CCS:TerminalBuffer).
- Provide the step response of the speed controller with/without the disturbance, which is applied after the speed settles at the desired speed. 
- Provide the input signals (PWM duty cycles) to the robot. 
- You can use any software you like - MATLAB, MS Excel, etc. for figures. Your plots must include labels, units, and legends whenever required. You should plot the region of interest.  Use the axis limit functions such as `plt.ylim` or `plt.xlim`.  
- Discuss the performance of your controller based on the response time, overshoot, and steady-state error.  Report the $K_p$ and $K_i$ values you used for these plots.
- Run `Program16_2()` and slightly hold one of the wheels to apply disturbance.  Run `Program17_1()` with a PI controller and do the same. Which one performs better? Explain why or why not.

```{warning} 
Take this part very seriously. The crucial part of your final report will be system performance analysis. Scientific analysis is primarily based on the information collected, often using figures. 
```

### Implement a controller to follow a line in `Program17_2()`

- Complete the `Controller()` function in `Program17_2.c`
- Write a proportional controller to drive the robot using the line following. 
- Experimentally determine the best proportional constant and swing values to create a stable system.
- Record the $K_p$ value and report it in the following section.
- Your robot must follow the white line in the maze. You are not allowed to change `reflectance.c`. If you change it, your other projects that used to work on a black line will fail.  There is a very simple method to make it work on white lines without modifying `reflectance.c`. 
- Demo `Program17_2` with the robot following the white line in the maze at any speed.
- You must place your robot at least **1 inch off the line** as shown in the figure below. Otherwise, you will not be able to measure the step response.
