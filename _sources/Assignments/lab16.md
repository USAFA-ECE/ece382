## ðŸ“œ Synopsis

In this lab, we will develop a software module that measures the speeds of motors and the displacement of the robot. The key element for measuring the speed and displacement of our robot is a Hall-effect sensor, a semiconductor device that produces a voltage proportional to the magnetic field. As shown in the figure below, a Hall-effect sensor can measure the magnetic field intensity of two magnets attached to a rotating plate.

The first goal of this lab is to write `Timer_A` software that can measure periods from the two encoders. The counter of `Timer_A` is 16-bit wide, so the period measurement will have a _precision_ of 16 bits. This means you can measure about 65536 different periods. The _resolution_ is the smallest change in the period the measurement can distinguish. The resolution in input capture mode is equal to the period of the selected clock. If you choose the SMCLK at 12 MHz, a prescale of 1, and an input divider of 1/8, the period measurement resolution will be 2/3 us. The maximum period that can be measured is the precision in alternatives times the resolution. At this clock and prescale, the **maximum** period that can be measured is about 43 ms.

The second goal is to use the period to determine wheel speed. Since there are 360 pulses per rotation, this 43 ms maximum means the slowest wheel speed that can be measured will be about 3.81 rpm. If $n$ is the period in 2/3 us units, then the angular speed of the wheel, $\omega$, in rpm can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
\omega = \frac{1\text{ pulse}}{2/3\cdot10^{-6}~s} \frac{1^\circ}{ n~\text{pulses} }\frac{1~\text{rev}}{360^\circ}\frac{60\text{ sec}}{1\text{ min}} 
= \frac{250,000}{n} \text{rpm}
\end{equation}

The third goal is to use the second input of the encoder to determine which direction the motor is spinning. You will write software that counts the number of pulses observed on each wheel as the robot moves. You will add to a counter as the robot moves forward and subtract from a counter as the robot moves backward. Then, the counter will be used to calculate the distance the wheel travels.


## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Setup

- Go to ECE382 Teams > General > Files > Class Materials > SourceFiles.
- Download `Lab16_Tachmain.c` from the Teams folder into your `/workspace/Lab16_Tach` folder using Windows File Explorer (not Code Composer Studio). **Caution**: It must be in the `Lab16_Tach` folder not in the `inc` folder.
- Download `Tachometer.c`, `Tachometer.h`, and `TA3InputCapture.c` into your workspace/inc folder using Windows File Explorer (not Code Composer Studio). **Caution**: It must be in the `inc` folder not in the `Lab16_Tach` folder.
- Right-click on your `Lab16_Tach` project in CCS and select "Add Files...". Browse to your `inc` folder and select `UART0.c`. Click Open. Ensure "Link to file" is selected and create a link to the "PROJECT\_LOC". 

### Complete functions in `TA3InputCapture.c`.

- **This is part of Homework 16** 
- Complete `TimerA3Capture_Init`, `TA3_0_IRQHandler()`, and `TA3_N_IRQHandler()` in `TA3InputCapture.c`.
- Follow the instructions inside `TA3InputCapture.c` to complete it.
- Copy and paste the code in Gradescope to submit your Homework 16.

Before starting this lab, check the solutions posted in Gradescope to ensure you have the correct code.  If the solution is not published in Gradescope, go through your code with your instructor.

### Demo `Program16_1()`


:::{important}
You should understand the main code provided in every module. No such code will be provided for your final project, and you must write your main.c from scratch.  
:::

- Complete LCDSpeed() in `Lab16_Tachmain.c`. The LCD should display the left and right tachometer periods and the speeds of both wheels in RPM as shown below.

```{image} ./figures/Lab16_Tachometer.png
:width: 300
:align: center
```
<br>

- Demo `Program16_1()` running at the speeds from 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 100\%, and back to 25\% as shown below.

</center>
<br>



### Graph duty cycle versus actual speed.

- `Program16_1()` stores the speed of each motor and the assigned duty cycles in the following buffers. 

```C
uint16_t PeriodBufferR[BUFFER_SIZE];    // to store right period
uint16_t PeriodBufferL[BUFFER_SIZE];    // to store left period
uint16_t SpeedBufferR[BUFFER_SIZE];     // to store right speed
uint16_t SpeedBufferL[BUFFER_SIZE];     // to store left speed
uint16_t DutyBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];       // to store duty cycles
```

- At the end of `Program16_1`, the LCD will display whether you want to transmit the data in the buffers, as shown below.

```{image} ./figures/Lab16_TxBuffer.png
:width: 300
:align: center
```
<br>

- Press the left switch to select Y (yes), but do not press a bump switch yet.
- Connect the USB cable to the robot and open the serial terminal as we did in [Lab 11](lab11-uart).
- Press a bump switch to start transmitting data to the serial terminal. The data will be transmitted as shown below. 

```{image} ./figures/Lab16_SerialTerminal.gif
:width: 700
:align: center
```
<br>

- Once the data transmission is complete, the LCD will display `TX is Done`.
- Select the entire data in the serial terminal except the header, `***Receiving buffer data***`.
- Copy the data into a text file and save it as a text file (.txt extension) or a comma-separated value file (.csv extension).
- Use a software tool of your choice to plot the duty cycle, the timer periods, and the actual speeds in rpm using the values from the `PeriodBuffer`, `SpeedBuffer` and `DutyBuffer` arrays.  Recommended software tools include, but are not limited to, MATLAB, Excel, Python with matplotlib, and Jupyter notebook.  You can also use this Jupyter notebook in Colab <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanbaek/ece382/blob/main/files/ECE382_Plots.ipynb">![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)</a>
    - The first column of the data is time in 10 milliseconds - 1 means 10ms and 2 means 20ms.
    - The axes must have labels and units, e.g., `time (sec)`. You must use the standard units, such as sec, ms, and us - 10ms is not a standard unit. So, you must convert the time data into seconds - You know how to convert the data in 10 ms into the values in sec.     
    - The duty cycle must be in percentage, not permyriad.
    - The speed must be in rpm, rad/sec, or deg/sec.

:::{caution}
The figures must have **_correct labels and units_**. You will only receive the full credit if labels and units are present or correct.

```{important}
Data-based analyses are critical in engineering and science. Videos and pictures are suitable for showcases but not essential elements in engineering experiments. You need to take measurements for your experiments and show your analyses based on the measurements. Taking measurements, generating meaningful plots, and comprehensive analyses will be a significant part of your final presentations and reports.

    - Speeds vs. time
    - Duty cycle vs. time

### Complete functions for `Program16_2`.

- Read `Tachometer.c` and `Tachometer.h` thoroughly.  
- Read the following functions thoroughly.  You need to understand how the semaphore, `IsControllerEnabled`, is used in multiple functions.

- `average()`
    - You will average a specific number of the latest tachometer readings stored in an array. 
    - The `average()` function will be used to calculate the average over an array.
    - This function is already implemented for you.
    
- Complete the `UpdateParameters()` function in `Program16_2`.
    - Use the two switches to increment the desired speed of each wheel by 10 rpm (sw1 - right and sw2 - left) and roll over if the maximum value is reached. 
    - Use the comments to complete the code inside the `while` loop.
    
- Complete the `Controller()` function in `Program16_2`.
    - Create a basic controller that will increase/decrease the speed of the wheels accordingly to get close to the desired speed.
    - Use the comments to complete the code.
        
- Demo `Program16_2()` that you can increase the desired speed of the wheels with the switches and display the actual and desired speeds and the distance traveled on the LCD. Show that both wheels are running at 50 rpm followed by 100 rpm. Slightly hold a wheel to add friction to the wheel and show that the speed controller maintains the desired speed. You also need to show that the desired speeds roll over if you reach the maximum value.
