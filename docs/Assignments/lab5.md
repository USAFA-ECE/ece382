## ðŸ“œ Synopsis

The objective of this lab is to interface a liquid crystal display (LCD) to the microcontroller and use it to output characters and numbers. The Nokia 5110 LCD shown below is a monocrhome display that is 84 pixels wide by 48 pixels high.

```

<br>

Each character on the LCD is defined by a 5 pixel wide by 8 pixel high image. You can see the font table as a constant array called ASCII inside `Nokia5110 .c`. For example, the letter '7' is defined as 0x01, 0x71, 0x09, 0x05, 0x03. This 40-bit value creates the image shown below on the display. The 0x01 is the first column and 0x03 is the last column, with bit 0 on top.

```

<br>

The `Nokia5110_OutChar` function inside `Nokia5110.c` finds the 40-bit value associated with the character passed to the function and displays the character on the LCD.  

```C
/**
 * Print a character to the Nokia 5110 48x84 LCD.  The
 * character will be printed at the current cursor position,
 * the cursor will automatically be updated, and it will
 * wrap to the next row or back to the top if necessary.
 * One blank column of pixels will be printed on either side
 * of the character for readability.  Since characters are 8
 * pixels tall and 5 pixels wide, 12 characters fit per row,
 * and there are six rows.
 * @param data  character to print
 * @return none
 * @note  LCD is in default horizontal addressing mode (V = 0)
 * @see Nokia5110_Init(), Nokia5110_Clear(), Nokia5110_SetCursor()
 * @brief  Print a character to the LCD
 * @note use Nokia5110_SetCursor to specify position
 */
void Nokia5110_OutChar(char data);

```

You need to use `Nokia5110_SetCursor2` to move the cursor to the desired row and column position on the LCD. The next character printed by `Nokia5110_OutChar` will be printed here. Read the documentation for `Nokia5110_SetCursor2` inside `nokia5110.h`

```{tip} 
The `workspace/inc` folder is where the actual .h and .c files are stored and allow us to use these files across multiple projects. The .c files are typically **linked** within the project folder, so editing the file in the project folder is actually editing the file inside the `inc` folder. The .h files are not linked.
```

In this lab, you need to implement the following functions inside `Nokia5110.c`.
- `Nokia5110_OutString`: Prints a string of characters to Nokia5110 LCD
- `Nokia5110_OutUDec`: Prints an unsigned number in variable-size format. 
- `Nokia5110_OutSDec`: Prints a signed number in variable-size format. 


```{important} 
Read `Nokia5110.h` before you start writing code. Putting the declarations in the header enables any code file that includes this header file to call these functions. 
```


## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Setup
- Connect the LaunchPad to your computer via the provided USB cable.
- Open Code Composer Studio (CCS) and select your workspace.
- Ensure your Project Explorer is open on the left of the CCS screen. 

### Run the `Program5_1` function to adjust constrast

- Open the `Lab05_SoftwareDesign` project by double-clicking it.
- Open `Lab05_SoftwareDesignMain.c` in the `Lab05_SoftwareDesign` project.
- Ensure `Program5_1` is uncommented inside the `main` function.
- Build and debug the program.
- It will display the Air Force logo as shown below.
- Adjust `CONSTRAST` if needed.

```

### Write the `Nokia5110_OutString` function

- In CCS open the `inc` project by double-clicking it.
- Open `Nokia5110.h` and read the documentation for the `Nokia5110_OutChar` and `Nokia5110_OutString` functions.

```{tip}
It is crucial to read and comprehend the documentation in header files. Typically, the documentation inside header files is provided to end users, but the contents of source files (*.c) are not usually provided to end users for various reasons, including security. Sometimes, source files are already compiled and end users are not permitted to read them. For example, SPIA3.obj inside Lab05_SoftwareDesign is already compiled and its source code cannot be read. However, you can read its header file, SPIA3.h.
```

- Open the `Lab05_SoftwareDesign` project by double-clicking it.
- Open `Nokia5110.c` in the `Lab05_SoftwareDesign` project.

```{note}
You may have noticed that `Nokia5110.c` is also located inside the `inc` project. The file is physically located inside the `inc` folder and the one insde the `Lab05_SoftwareDesign` project is a **link** to the file in the `inc` folder.  We need a link, not a copy, of the file because we need the file across multiple projects.  If you have a copy of the file, you have to re-copy the file to every project everytime you modify it.
```

- Find the `Nokia5110_OutString` function inside `Nokia5110.c`.
- The input arguemnt, `ptr`, of the fucntion is a pointer to a string, i.e., `ptr` is the address of the first character of the string.  A string in C is an array of characters with the Null character (ASCII value 0) at the end. A string in C can be initialized in many different ways. For example,

```C
char str[7] = {'E','C','E','3','8','2','\0'};
char str[] = {'E','C','E','3','8','2','\0'};
char str[10] = "ECE382";  // array size can be > 7. C compilers will put \0 at str[6] ... str[9]
char str[] = "ECE382";    // C compilers will append Null (\0) at the end. 
char *str = "ECE382";     // C compilers will append Null (\0) at the end.
```

The last two methods would be the best to define a string in C.  Note that an array is a pointer.  In the above example, the `str` variable from `char str[] = "ECE382"` holds the **address** of the first letter, 'E', in "ECE382". So, you can access 'E' by `*str` or `str[0]` and 'C' by `*(str+1)` or `str[1]`.  The difference between arrays and pointers is that a memory space must be allocated to an array during the compile time (you must define them with a size) whereas no memory space needs to be allocated to a pointer when it is define.  If we need to allocate a memory space to a pointer during the runtime, we can use *malloc* or *calloc*.  

```{tip}
An array is considered to be the same thing as a pointer to the first item in the array. Therefore, an array is a pointer. 
```

- Use a `while` to iterate each character in the string until you see the Null chracter and print the character to the Nokia LCD using the `Nokia5110_OutChar` function.  
- Write this function in 2 lines and earn extra bonus points.  **Hint**: Use a pointer with increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operators.  
- Use `Program5_2` to test your function.
- Demo your LCD printing "LCD Test", a small AF logo, letters, a hexadecimal number, and a binary number on the LCD as shown below. Please ignore the two decimal number in the bottom row.

```{important}
Ensure you understand how to use the `Nokia5110_SetCursor2`.  You will be using the Nokia LCD throughout the semester for high-level debugging, and you are required to use it extensively for the final project. 
```


### Write the `Nokia5110_OutUDec` and `Nokia5110_OutSDec` functions

Let's implemente two functions for the entire integer types: one for unsigned integers and another for signed integers.  

```{important}
Ensure you understand the test programs. You may be asked to write such programs in GRs.
```

- In CCS open the `inc` project by double-clicking it.
- Open `Nokia5110.h` and read the documentation for the `Nokia5110_OutUDec` and `Nokia5110_OutSDec`functions.
- You can use these functions to print any signed and unsigned intergers to the Nokia LCD.
- Open `Nokia5110.c` in the `Lab05_SoftwareDesign` project and carefully read the `Nokia_Num2String` function.

```{tip}
Notice that `Nokia_Num2String` is a **static function** as it has the **static** qualifer. A static function in C is a **private (or internal) function** that cannot be called externally. The function can be called by other functions defined inside the same file the static function is defined.  This is why there is no documentation of this function in the header file. 
```

- Now, implement `Nokia5110_OutUDec` that first calls the `Nokia_Num2String` function.
- Remember `Nokia_Num2String` returns `count`, the number of digits in the string.
- Use `count` and `min_length` to determine the length of the string to print on the LCD to print spaces to the LCD. Remember that `Nokia5110_OutU16Dec` prints **right-justified digits**.
- Then print the string inside StrNum in the reverse order.
- Use `Program5_3` to test this function.
- Then, implement `Nokia5110_OutSDec`, which is very similar to `Nokia5110_OutUDec`.  The only difference is that you need to add a negative sign ('-') or a space (' ') in front of the integer.

```{tip}
If a signed 8-bit integer n is -128, `int8_t x = -n` assigns -128 to x not 128 because the 2's complement of -128 is -128 in 8-bit signed numbers. If x is an unsigned integer, however, `x = -n` will assign 128 to x.
```

- Use `Program5_3` to test these functions.
- Demo your LCD displaying numbers as shown below.


:::{important}
You may wonder why we don't use printf or sprintf for formated outputs.  For example, 
```C
char* strnum;
uint_16 n = 12345;
sprintf(strnum, "%6d", n); // strnum --> " 12345"
```
printf and sprintf are macros (not functions) in C and they are extremeley slow.  So, they are not used in the world of embedded systems and software.

</center>

```{tip}
Implement and test one function at a time, and then move to the next function. Do not write everything at once and expect they are all working fine.  
```
