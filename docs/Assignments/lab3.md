# ðŸ”¬ Lab 3 Memory 

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Students should be able to write assembly code to access memory using the LDR and STR instructions.
- Students should be able to find values stored in registers and memory space using the CCS debugging tools.

```{note}
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
```


```{tip}
**START EARLY!** You need to write only 10 - 15 lines of assembly code, but it may take **much longer** than you expect. Start early and seek EI if needed!
```

## ðŸ“œ Synopsis
In this lab, you will write an Assembly program determining whether given integers are prime or composite.  A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible by only 1 and itself.  The equivalent C program is provided in `Lab03_PrimeMain.c` in the `Lab03_PrimeNumbers` project.

The array of numbers to test is {1, 2, 7, 10, 15, 62, 97, 282, 408, 467, 967, 6687, 25913, 25481, 118061, 0}. The number 0 at the end of the array is to indicate the end of array.  The result array should be {0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, x}, where 1 denotes `prime`, 0 denotes `composite`, and x denotes `don't care`.

An integer $n$ is not divisible by a number $m$ if $n/2 < m < n$.  For example, 15 is not divisible by any number between 7.5 and 15, i.e., 15 is not divisible by 8, 9, ... , or 14.  So, you don't have to check if 15 is divisible by these numbers.  That's why we have
```C
for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++)  //  m is  n/2
```

## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Setup
- Connect the LaunchPad to your computer via the provided USB cable.
- Open Code Composer Studio (CCS) and select your workspace.
- Ensure your Project Explorer is open on the left of the CCS screen. Otherwise, select View > Project Explorer.
- Open the `Lab03_PrimeNumbers` project by double-clicking it.


### Run main.c

Open `Lab03_PrimeMain.c` in the `Lab03_PrimeNumbers` project and carefully read the code. If you click on `Resume` (F8) followed by `Suspend` (Alt+F8), it will stop at `while(1);`.  Observe the values of the `Res` array in the `Expressions` tab. You may need to click on `>` next to `Res` to expand the array into individual variables. Take a screenshot of the contents of `Res` after execution of the code.

```{warning}
Please take a screenshot of the region of interest and ensure that it is legible. If your instructor has trouble reading it, you might not get full credit.
```

```{attention}
You will receive a grade of **-10 points** if you submit a picture of a computer screen taken by your phone or mobile device.
```

### Complete `LaLab03_Prime.asm`


```{tip}
Before you start writing code, carefully read both `Lab03_PrimeMain.c` and `LaLab03_Prime.asm` and the comments in them.
```

- Exclude `Lab03_PrimeMain.c` from Build and include `LaLab03_Prime.asm`.


**Modulo**

For the modulo operation, use the assembly code provided below.  

```asm
UDIV R8, R0, R6 ; R8 = R0/R6 (n/i)
MUL  R9, R8, R6 ; R9 = int(n/i) * i
CMP  R0, R9     ; n == int(n/i) * i ?,  n is divisible by i if R0 == R9.
```

**Add your code to `LaLab03_Prime.asm`**

- Use `Lab03_PrimeMain.c` as a reference to complete the assembly code. Please read all the comments before writing any code. 
- It is important to **comment your code**. You must add a comment to every line for this assignment. 
- You can search the `Memory Browser` by variable name or memory address, such as the contents of `Result` after execution of the code.  You need to change the encoding style (number format) to **8-Bit Hex - TI Style** as shown below. If you click on Resume (F8 or green arrow) followed by Suspend (Alt+F8), it will stop at `Stall B Stall`. Then, you can browse the memory.

```{figure} ./figures/Lab03_PrimeResultMemory.png
---
width: 380
align: center
name: result_memory
---
Memory Browser with 8-Bit Hex encoding style.
```

If you select a wrong encoding style as shown below, you will not be able to correctly read the values inside `Result`.  

```{image} ./figures/Lab03_PrimeResultMemoryBad.png

:align: center
```

```{tip}
There are many assembly examples in CCS if you are looking for assembly syntax.  For example, take a look at `Example04_ArrayAdd` for LDR, LDRB, STRB, loops, etc.  
```

```{note}
`ASR` is a shift operator, which is the same as `>>` in C.  If you right shift a number by 1, it is the same as dividing by 2.  For example, b1000 (8) >> 1 = b0100 (4).
```

```{tip}
If you divide 7 by 2, the answer is 3, not 3.5 in C.  If you divide 7.0 by 2, the answer is 3.5.
```

```C
float y = 7/2;   // y is 3.0, integer division (3) followed by type casting w/ float
float y = 7.0/2; // y is 3.5
int y = 7.0/2;   // y is 3, floating division (3.5) followed by type casting w/ int
```

## ðŸšš Deliverables

### Deliverable 1
- **[4 pts]** Run `Lab03_PrimeMain.c` in the `Lab03_PrimeNumbers` project and take a screenshot showing the contents of `Res` after the execution of the code. You must **expand** the array to show the individual values in the array.


### Deliverable 2
- **[7.5 pts]** Complete `LaLab03_Prime.asm` and add a comment to every line of your code. Push your code to your repository. **It is your responsibility to check your files have been successfully pushed to your Bitbucket repository.**

```{warning}
Your code must be **compilable**.  If your code throws any compile errors, you will get **a grade of 0** for Deliverable 2.
```

### Deliverable 3

- **[4 pts]** Provide screenshots showing the **addresses** of `Result` and `Nums`, stored in RAM/ROM (use the Memory Browser and the pointers you created).

### Deliverable 4
- **[4 pts]** Provide a screenshot showing the **contents** of `Result`, stored in memory after execution of the code (use the Memory Browser and change the format to **8-Bit Hex - TI Style**).

- **[-10 pts]** Take pictures of your screen with a mobile device or digital camera and submit them in Gradescope. Yes, I am serious...
