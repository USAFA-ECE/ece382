# ðŸ”¬ Lab 8 I/O Interface

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Students should be able to interface switches and LEDs to a microcontroller using TI's LaunchPad development board.
- Students should be able to write assembly code to configure switches as inputs and LEDs as outputs.


```{note}
There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. -Alan J. Perlis

## ðŸ“œ Synopsis

In this lab you will design, develop, and test a window intruder detector alarm system. The block diagram of the system is shown below.

```
<br>

Our window intruder detector alarm system is equipped with three inputs and one output. The inputs consist of three switches that are implemented with **positive logic**. The rightmost bump switch, which is called _Activate_, serves as the arm/disarm control. 
The two left bump switches connected to P4.7 and P4.6 are two window sensors, which are named _Window1_ and _Window2_ respectively. When _Activate_ is pressed or true, the security system is activated. When _Activate_ is not pressed or false, the system is deactivated, meaning the alarm will be _OFF_ regardless of the state of the window sensors. The window is in a secure position when the window sensor is pressed or true. It is unsafe if either window sensor is not pressed. The output consists of an LED called _Alarm_ that is implemented in positive logic. The LED flashes at 1 Hz (on for 50 ms, off for 50 ms) to signify the unsafe condition when either Window1 or Window2 detects an intruder based on the truth table below.

## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Setup
- Connect the LaunchPad to your computer via the provided USB cable.
- Open Code Composer Studio (CCS) and select your starter workspace.
- Ensure your Project Explorer is open on the left of the CCS screen. Otherwise, select View > Project Explorer.
- Open the `Lab08_InterfacingIO` project by double-clicking it.
- Open the `Lab08_InterfacingIOmain.c` file by double-clicking it.

### Implement the bump sensors

- Please read `Bump.h` in the `inc` folder. You can also open it by right-clicking `#include "â€¦/inc/Bump.h"` and selecting Open Declaration (F3). 
- Complete `Bump_Init()` and `Bump_Read()` in `Bump.c`.
- In Homework 8, you already wrote the function to initialize the bump sensors, `Bump_Init()`. This function sets the appropriate port pins and enables internal resistors as pull-up resistors (active low). 
- A second function, `Bump_Read()`, reads the switches and returns one 8-bit result. 
- The bump sensors are active-low, which means that when pressed they will switch from a 1 to a 0. 
- We want the output of our `Bump_Read()` function to return a 1 when pressed, so you should **invert** the result before returning from the function.
- The bump sensors are connected to P4.7-P4.5, P4.3, P4.2, and P4.0. 
- If the two middle sensors are pressed, P4 will be 0b110x01x1, where x denotes `unknown (donâ€™t care)`. Since it is negative logic, 0 means _pressed_ and 1 means _not pressed_. 
- The function returns an 8-bit unsigned integer. The first 6 bits (Bit0 - Bit5) of the return value must be the sensor output with positive logic. If the two middle sensors are pressed, the function must return 0b00001100.
- In the function, you need to **invert** the sensor reading and perform **select-shift-combine** operations.

```{admonition} Q&A
**Q**: I don't understand what/why we are shifting in Bump Read.
<br>
**A**: If you look in the comments for Bump_Init, the switches are mapped to pins 7-5, 3-2, and 0. You want to move everything, so it's in bits 5-0.
```

- Demo `Program8_1()` testing the bump switches as shown below.

<br>

```{warning}
If you want to give a video demo, use a screen recorder such as ScreenToGif or OBS Studio - they are free. Do not record your screen with a mobile device or a webcam. If you do so, **you will get -10 points**.
```

### Demo `Program8_2()` with Moku:Go Oscilloscope

```{warning}
Do not use the alligator clip to clamp the ground pin. If the alligator clip touches another pin on your LaunchPad, **it may fry your LaunchPad**. 
```

- Turn off your LaunchPad. **Do not connect** an oscilloscope probe to your LaunchPad while it is on.
- Connect an oscilloscope probe to your LaunchPad as shown below. Use a jumper wire to connect the ground signal.

```{image} ./figures/Lab08_OscConnections.png
:scale: 80%
:align: center
```
<br>

**Steps to use the Oscilloscope**

We will now utilize Moku:Go Oscilloscope to observe the signal sent over P1.0 to determine if the LED is blinking at a rate of 1 Hz. 

- Run `Program8_2()` to  test `LED_Oscillate` you implemented in Homework 8. 
- Your Moku:Go will turn on automatically when connected to power.  Connect the magnetic power supply to the magnetic power adapter.  To turn off Moku:Go, unplug the power source.
- The LED on Moku:Go is off when the power is disconnected. While Moku:Go is booting, the LED is orange. When Moku:Go is ready, the LED becomes green. 
- Connect the Moku:Go to your computer via a USB-C cable.
- Once you have connected your Moku:Go to your computer, you can start using your device with the Moku:Go App. Launch the Moku:Go App on your computer. The Moku:Go device connected by USB will appear on the `Select your device` page as shown below.
- Double click your Moku:Go tile to start using your device. The default name of your Moku:Go is `Moku-######`, where `######` is the 6-digit serial number printed on the bottom of the device.
- On the `Select your instrument` menu, double click Oscilloscope.
- Change the voltage level and time span by scrolling your mouse up or down as shown below. The time span should be at least 4 seconds or you need to have at least 5 periods (repeating signals) on your window.
- Ensure the trigger mode is `Normal`, the type is `Edge`, and the level is at least 3 V.
- Click the Ruler button (Measurement) to measure the frequency.  You can measure the period instead of the frequency if you prefer.

```{image} ./figures/Lab08_MokuGo.gif
:scale: 80%
:align: center
```

<br>

- To get the frequency of your signal to be 1 Hz (period = 1 sec), you need to adjust your `DELAY` in `LEDs.asm`. No trial and error is needed for this. You can easily find the correct value of `DELAY` using a simple ratio.
- Click the **Cloud** button (Export Data) and export the screenshot to your local folder.  
- Submit the screenshot in Gradescope.

### Implement alarm algorithm in Program8_3()

- Within Lab08_LED_Switchesmain.c, use `Program8_3()` to implement the alarm algorithm discussed in Synopsis and depicted in the block diagram below.

```{image} ./figures/Lab08_FlowChart.png
:width: 380
:align: center
```
<br>

- The system starts with the LED off.
- Wait about 100 ms.
- Look at the three bump switches; if `Activate` is pressed and one or both `Window1` and `Window2` are not pressed, then toggle the LED else turn the LED off.
- You must use the functions in `LED.asm`.
- Demo `Program8_3()`
